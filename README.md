Why make this when you can just filter by size in file explorer?
</b>
<p>
This was made to help find hard-to-find large files that take up a lot of hard drive space.
Command line applications are simpler to run quickly and this is formatted nicer. 
Also for some reason my breadth first search is faster on large directories, such as your C: drive.

Given no one else will look at this, haven't you saved less time overall?
